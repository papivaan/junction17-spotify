# junction17-spotify

Welcome to use our Spotify API powered party music list! We created this masterpiece at Junction Hackathon 2017.

On Request tab you can search songs by song name and then ask for the DJ to confirm them to be added to the playlist. Or simply search for samba. We recommend samba!

DJ tab is for the DJ to see all the requested songs and either confirm or decline them.

The Playlist tab is where you can see all the songs added to the playlist.

This project was built using Vue.js, Node.js, Firebase and Heroku.
